#  Global security threat: A Decade of Global Cybersecurity Threats (2015â€“2024) 

## Project Overview
Over the past decade, cybersecurity threats have evolved significantly, both in frequency and complexity. The dataset provides a deep dive into 3,000 cyber incidents across countries, industries, and attack types, revealing crucial insights into the global threat landscape.
This 10-year snapshot of cybersecurity activity illustrates the growing scale, complexity, and cost of digital threats. By examining who is targeted, how attacks unfold, and what defenses are most effective, we can identify vulnerabilities, strengthen resilience, and guide smarter investments in cybersecurity

##  The Problem

Over the last decade, cyberattacks have grown in scale, frequency, and damage. Industries from finance to healthcare report millions of dollars in losses and hundreds of thousands of users affected per incident.

Despite growing investment in cybersecurity tools, these attacks continue to wreak havoc.
This raises a critical question: Why are cyberattacks still so damaging?

##  Objectives

To analyze a decade of global cybersecurity threats, with the goal of:

- Quantifying the financial and operational impact.
- Identifying the most affected countries, industries, and attack vectors.
- Pinpointing vulnerabilities and resolution inefficiencies.
- Offering data-driven insights and recommendations to strengthen cyber resilience.

##  Analysis

#### Global Financial Impact

-  The total financial loss from cyber incidents between 2015 and 2024 reached a staggering $151.48 billion, averaging $50.49 million annually.

#### User Impact by Country

-  Brazil and the UK reported the most affected users, with 169 million and 157 million respectively.
-  Other highly impacted countries include France, Russia, and India, each with user exposure exceeding 140 million.

#### Sector Vulnerability
 - The IT, banking, and healthcare sectors were the top three targets, with each seeing over 200 million users affected.
 - Government and telecommunications also faced significant breaches, indicating widespread vulnerability across both public and private infrastructures.

#### Attack Sources and Methods

Nation-state actors were the predominant source of attacks, responsible for 395 million compromised users, followed closely by attacks from unknown sources.
The leading attack vectors were:

- DDoS (265.2M users affected, $27.6B loss)
- SQL Injection
- Phishing
- Ransomware
- Malware
Notably, phishing and DDoS attacks were among the costliest in terms of financial losses.

#### Exploited Vulnerabilities
- Zero-day vulnerabilities and weak passwords were the most exploited, collectively resulting in over 775 million user compromises and $77 billion in losses.
- Other major vulnerabilities included social engineering and unpatched software, highlighting persistent gaps in basic cyber hygiene.

  #### Defensive Efficiency

Among various defense strategies, Firewall led in resolution speed with an average of 36.9 hours, closely followed by antivirus detection and encryption methods.

##  Recommendation

Based on this analysis:
-  Allocate greater security resources to high-risk sectorsâ€”particularly IT, banking, and healthcareâ€”as they remain the primary targets of cyberattacks
-  Implement company-wide password policies and multi-factor authentication as Zero-day exploits and weak passwords caused $77B in damages
-  Prioritize robust firewall and intrusion prevention system (IPS) deployments as firewalls showed the fastest average resolution time
-  Ensure antivirus software and endpoint protection solutions are regularly updated as antivirus showed the fastest average resolution time
-  Employ DDoS mitigation services and rate-limiting technologies as DDoS and phishing caused the greatest financial losses
-  Promote a security-first culture through mandatory training and certifications as many breaches stemmed from preventable issues like unpatched software
